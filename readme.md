## Parallel Algorithms Implementation 

# OpenMP
1. Algorithms implemented include Euler tour, and Inorder, Preorder traversals.
2. Optimized the algorithms to achieve O(log(n)) complexity.

# CUDA Programming
1. Implemented simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm using CUDA and achieved complexity of O(Depth of Tree * Max Degree of Node) through vertex-level parallelism.
2. Implemented a Cut Vertex algorithm with O(Depth of Tree * Max Degree of Node) complexity.
3. Implemented BellmanFord
